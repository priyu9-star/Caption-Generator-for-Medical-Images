# 🧠 Caption Generator for Medical Images

A deep learning-based system that automatically generates descriptive medical captions for input radiology images. This project combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction with recurrent neural networks (LSTM) for sequence generation to assist radiologists and improve accessibility in healthcare documentation.

## 🔍 Features

- Automatic caption generation for medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs).
- CNN + LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture.
- Pretrained models used for image feature extraction (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
- Trained on medical image-caption datasets.
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for demonstration and analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pre-trained CNN (ResNet50 / VGG16)
- Natural Language Processing (NLTK / spaCy)
